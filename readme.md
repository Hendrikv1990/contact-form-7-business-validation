## Contact Form 7 Business Email Validation 

Handy plugin to validate your contact form 7 with business emails. Sometimes you don't want personal emails to signup. 
Especially for B2B landing pages this is very helpful

### Setup

1. If a language plugin is used, I would recommend to just include a hidden in the form called 'lang' and pass the value of the language. Currently only have de / us. But easy to adjust
2. The name of the email tag needs to be called 'email'
3. Check the domains.json, if you'd like to add some more things there.

### future features

1. automatically detect the email that is being posted
2. automatically detect language
3. enhance the languages support

### version 1.0
